			Zelda Overworld Terrain Randomizer</a> <br />
			A Common Lisp program (with a bit of Java) that shuffles up the
			overworld terrain from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> to make new
			overworlds. It can make an image of the new map and a playable
			rom with the new overworld. Due to the nature of the project, 
			the rom isn't exactly a full game, though.

			Lambda Calculus Interpreter</a> <br />
		A lambda calculus interpreter written in Java with a terminal window
		and an editor. Built for playing around with lambda calculus that
		looks like lambda calculus. Not particularly powerful or robust.

			<img class="postimage" src="badlands.png" />Hexmap Maker</a> <br />
		A Java program for making hexmaps. I wrote it in a couple days because
		I wanted a tool to make a hexmap for a D&D campaign, didn't have an
		immediately obvious option for such a program, and thought it would
		be interesting to write one, so I wrote my own.
