<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I'm a programmer with a long history of enjoying mathematics, which led
comfortably into my Bachelor's in computer science and physics (a double
major) at Wheaton College (IL). Since then, I have handled the entire
development cycle for a few automatic document editing programs.</p>
<p>
I'm a very quick learner, and I have a
love of solving puzzles and working with computers. In my spare time,
I play ultimate frisbee, learn scattered bits of history that I happen
to be interested in, play and run D&D, enjoy a wide range of video games,
and work on programming projects I want to see made (some of my better ones
are mentioned below). Over years of playing cello, I have also gained a
strong appreciation for classical music from the romantic era.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I am a capable and adaptable programmer with a wide range of other
abilities and very strong problem-solving (and problem-spotting) skills.
</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>
	There are more projects on <a href="http://github.com/BionicRADAR">my Github</a>,
	but these ones are my best.
	</p>
	<div class="post">
		<a href="/zeldaoverworldterrainrandomizer">
		<img class="postimage" src="zeldasample.png" />
			Zelda Overworld Terrain Randomizer</a> <br />
			A Common Lisp program (with a bit of Java) that shuffles up the
			overworld terrain from <i>The Legend of Zelda</i> to make new
			overworlds. It can make an image of the new map and a playable
			rom with the new overworld. Due to the nature of the project, 
			the rom isn't exactly a full game, though.
	</div>
	<div class="post">
		<a href="https://github.com/BionicRADAR/LambdaCalculusInterpreter">
			<img class="postimage" src="lambdasample.png" />
			Lambda Calculus Interpreter</a> <br />
		A lambda calculus interpreter written in Java with a terminal window
		and an editor. Built for playing around with lambda calculus that
		looks like lambda calculus. Not particularly powerful or robust.

	<div class="post">
		<a href="https://github.com/BionicRADAR/hexmapmaker">
			<img class="postimage" src="badlands.png" />Hexmap Maker</a> <br />
		A Java program for making hexmaps. I wrote it in a couple days because
		I wanted a tool to make a hexmap for a D&D campaign, didn't have an
		immediately obvious option for such a program, and thought it would
		be interesting to write one, so I wrote my own.
